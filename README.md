# Data Abstraction

This is a collection of small projects ideas 
to practice applying the four steps of data abstraction.

##1. Specification
Specification of public interface
##2. Usage Scenarios
Looking at all the ways that the abstraction will be used.
##3.Testing
Writing a through and rigorous test suite for every operation prior to implementation.
##4.Implementing
Involves deciding on the internal representation of the data in the abstraction.
The tests should all pass when the implementation is done.
